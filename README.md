##  Running Tests
a) Running All Tests
You can run all tests in your project with the following command:
- python manage.py test
* This command discovers and runs tests from all apps listed in INSTALLED_APPS, including those in tests directories.

b) Running Tests from a Specific App

For example:
- python manage.py test child
This command runs tests specifically in the apps/child/tests/ directory.

c) Running Tests from a Specific File
- python manage.py test app_name.tests.test_file
For example:
- python manage.py test child.tests.test_models

# Run Coverage on a Specific Module
coverage run --source='apps.child.models' manage.py test
coverage run --source='apps' manage.py test
